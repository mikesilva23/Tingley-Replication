# Assortative Mating Could Operate Through Olfactory Mechanisms Replication

Tingley, McDermott, and Hatemi (2014) find that olfactory senses could explain assortative mating byideology. My replication of this paper succeeded except for minor discrepancies which do not affect hisconclusions. Through my extension, I further evaluate the three models Tingley, McDermott, and Hatemiuse by applying a Bayesian framework instead of a regular linear model. I further use the sampled iterationscreated bystan_lmto graph density plots of the main coefficient being evaluated in the respective models.Through this framework, I confirm that Tingleyâ€™s model illustrates little variability in their coefficients. Thedata and code used in this analysis replication is available on my github.
